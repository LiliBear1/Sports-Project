# Sports Project
Team Project 1 - Conceiving and executing a design that solves a real-world problem.


## Description
We are combining all of the skills we have learnt thus far throughout the course to create and execute an application which integrates data received from multiple server-side API requests as well as continue to learn about agile development methodologies to work collaboratively. 

This is a Football Feed app which will allow a user to look up their favourite football team and be provided with info about past and present features/matches so that they can see what games they want to attend and also find surrounding articles about the team and players so that they can keep up to date with the team.
