# Proposal


## Football Feed


## Project Description

* Conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. 

* Continue to learn about agile development methodologies to help you work collaboratively.

* We are combining all of the skills we have learnt thus far throughout the course to create and execute an application which integrates data received from multiple server-side API requests as well as continue to learn about agile development methodologies to work collaboratively.  

* We have decided to go for a Sports API foucusing on football/soccer most likely. The user story can be found below and will be on the repo once it is set up. 

* This is a Football Feed app which will allow a user to look up their favourite football team and be provided with info about past and present features/matches so that they can see what games they want to attend and also find surrounding articles about the team and players so that they can keep up to date with the team.




## Key Topics to cover

* Server-side APIs

* Git branching workflow

* Agile software development

We should be able to:

* Speak technically about a feature implemented in our project

* Explain and execute git branching workflow in a collaborative project

* Resolve merge conflicts

* Explain agile software development

* Design, build, and deploy a client-side web application using GitHub Pages

* Prepare a professional presentation and repository README for your project


# Ideas discussed

* Bitcoin API for tracking changes of value in time - but the APi doesn't look comprehensive, so avoid?

* Wikipedia API - Basically a second Google

* Meal Planner - There is a meal planner API, however this looks like it requires charges, but we may be able to find something on Google (We think this may be overdone)

* Recipe API with a Nutrition API or Workout Planner

* Weather API and Attraction Info to create Itinerary for area

* Love Calculator API - just for fun

* Sports - Statistics with with events related to team e.g. upcoming features and matches and maybe News/Media or Wiki surrounding teams?


# User Stories

AS A user I WANT TO 
Look up my favourite football team and be
Provided with info about past and present features/matches 
SO THAT I can see what games I want to attend and
I WANT to also find surrounding articles about the team and players 
SO THAT I can keep up to date with my team.

# Wireframe or Sketch of Design

In progress - To be updated 

# APIs

Checking free APIs available for developers on sites such as https://rapidapi.com/collection/list-of-free-apis


# Rough Breakdown of tasks

* Implement feature and bug fixes using git branch workflow and pull requests.

* Write user stories and acceptance criteria in GitHub Issues to help team stay on track with the project. 

* Using GitHub Project as a means to track status of project tasks will help you understand the benefits of Kanban boards.

* End the week by presenting project to class. 

* Once project is complete, update  professional materials and add new project to portfolio.
