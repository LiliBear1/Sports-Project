# Proposal


## Project Title


## Project Description

* Conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. 

* Continue to learn about agile development methodologies to help you work collaboratively. 

* We have decided to go for a Sports API foucusing on football/soccer most likely. The user story can be found below and will be on the repo once it is set up. 


## Key Topics to cover

* Server-side APIs

* Git branching workflow

* Agile software development

We should be able to:

* Speak technically about a feature implemented in our project

* Explain and execute git branching workflow in a collaborative project

* Resolve merge conflicts

* Explain agile software development

* Design, build, and deploy a client-side web application using GitHub Pages

* Prepare a professional presentation and repository README for your project


# Ideas discussed

* Bitcoin API for tracking changes of value in time - but the APi doesn't look comprehensive, so avoid?

* Wikipedia API - Basically a second Google

* Meal Planner - There is a meal planner API, however this looks like it requires charges, but we may be able to find something on Google (We think this may be overdone)

* Recipe API with a Nutrition API or Workout Planner

* Weather API and Attraction Info to create Itinerary for area

* Love Calculator API - just for fun

* Sports - Statistics with with events related to team e.g. upcoming features and matches and maybe News/Media or Wiki surrounding teams?


# User Stories

AS A user I WANT TO 
Look up my favourite football team and be
Provided with info about past and present features/matches 
SO THAT I can see what games I want to attend and
I WANT to also find surrounding articles about the team and players 
SO THAT I can keep up to date with my team.

# Wireframe or Sketch of Design

In progress - To be updated 

# APIs

Checking free APIs available for developers on sites such as https://rapidapi.com/collection/list-of-free-apis


# Rough Breakdown of tasks

* Implement feature and bug fixes using git branch workflow and pull requests.

* Write user stories and acceptance criteria in GitHub Issues to help team stay on track with the project. 

* Using GitHub Project as a means to track status of project tasks will help you understand the benefits of Kanban boards.

* End the week by presenting project to class. 

* Once project is complete, update  professional materials and add new project to portfolio.
